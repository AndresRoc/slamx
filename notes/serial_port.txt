rpi 3 serial ports

By default the uart on the header shows up at /dev/ttyS0.
It's normally used by the console.
That can be disabled by editing /boot/cmdline.txt
The pins should be marked as ALT5 in the gpio mode settings.

gpio readall

| 8  | 1 | ALT5 | TxD     | 15  | 14  |
| 10 | 1 | ALT5 | RxD     | 16  | 15  |

Don't disable the console with raspi-config - that will remove /dev/ttyS0 as well

Older rpi's used /dev/ttyAMA0
That used for the BT radio now (hciuart)
